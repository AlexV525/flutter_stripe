Integrate Stripe’s prebuilt payment UI into the checkout of your app with the PaymentSheet class.

This integration combines all of the steps required to pay—collecting payment details and confirming the payment—into a single sheet that displays on top of your app.


### 1. Set up Stripe [Server Side] [Client Side]

First, you need a Stripe account. [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).

#### Server-side

This integration requires endpoints on your server that talk to the Stripe API. Use one official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your server. [Follow the steps here](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#setup-server-side)

#### Client-side

The Flutter SDK is open source, fully documented.

To install the SDK, follow these steps:
 - Run the commmand `flutter pub add flutter_stripe`
 - This will add a line like this to your project's pubspec.yaml with the latest package version


For details on the latest SDK release and past versions, see the [Releases](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe/releases) page on GitHub. To receive notifications when a new release is published, [watch releases for the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-subscriptions-for-activity-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions#watching-releases-for-a-repository).


When your app starts, configure the SDK with your Stripe [publishable key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) so that it can make requests to the Stripe API. 

```dart
void main() async {
  Stripe.publishableKey = stripePublishableKey;
  runApp(const App());
}
```

Use your [test mode](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#obtain-api-keys) keys while you test and develop, and your [live mode](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#test-live-modes) keys when you publish your app.

### 2. Add an enpoint [Server Side]

First, you need a Stripe account. [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).

#### Server-side

This integration uses three Stripe API objects:

1. A [PaymentIntent](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents). Stripe uses this to represent your intent to collect payment from a customer, tracking your charge attempts and payment state changes throughout the process.

2. A [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers) (optional). To set up a card for future payments, it must be attached to a Customer. Create a Customer object when your customer creates an account with your business. If your customer is making a payment as a guest, you can create a Customer object before payment and associate it with your own internal representation of the customer’s account later.

3. A Customer Ephemeral Key (optional). Information on the Customer object is sensitive, and can’t be retrieved directly from an app. An Ephemeral Key grants the SDK temporary access to the Customer.

>> If you never save cards to a Customer and don’t allow returning Customers to reuse saved cards, you can omit the Customer and Customer Ephemeral Key objects from your integration.

For security reasons, your app can’t create these objects. Instead, add an endpoint on your server that:

1. Retrieves the Customer, or creates a new one.
2. Creates an Ephemeral Key for the Customer.
3. Creates a PaymentIntent, passing the Customer id.
4. Returns the Payment Intent’s [client secret](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret), the Ephemeral Key’s secret, and the Customer’s id to your app.

Check examples implementations for your server [here](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios#add-server-endpoint)

### 3. Integrate the payment sheet [Client Side]

Before displaying the payment sheet, your checkout page should:

- Show the products being purchased and the total amount
- Collect any required shipping information
- Include a checkout button to present Stripe’s UI

Next, integrate Stripe’s prebuilt payment UI into your app’s checkout.

```dart
Future<void> initPaymentSheet() async {
    try {
      // 1. create payment intent on the server
      final data = await _createTestPaymentSheet();

      // 2. initialize the payment sheet
      await Stripe.instance.initPaymentSheet(
        paymentSheetParameters: SetupPaymentSheetParameters(
          merchantDisplayName: 'Flutter Stripe Store Demo',
          paymentIntentClientSecret: data['paymentIntent'],
          customerId: data['customer'],
          customerEphemeralKeySecret: data['ephemeralKey'],
        ),
      );
      setState(() {
        _ready = true;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Error: $e')),
      );
      rethrow;
    }
}
```

When the customer taps a **Checkout** button, call present to present the payment sheet. After the customer completes the payment, the sheet is dismissed.


```dart
   await Stripe.instance.presentPaymentSheet(
          parameters: PresentPaymentSheetParameters(
        clientSecret: _paymentSheetData!['paymentIntent'],
        confirmPayment: true,
    ),
  )
```


Unless your business model requires immediate payment (e.g., an on-demand service), don’t assume you have received payment at this point. Instead, inform the customer that you confirmed their order and notify them by email when you fulfill their order in the next step.
